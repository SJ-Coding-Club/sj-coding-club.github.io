<p>I think what discourages a lot of people from programming is this idea of learning to solely code for the sake of getting a job or for your resume, or whatever. If that is your goal, you'll probably give up or lose interest pretty quickly, because programming is not always one of those things where you see crazy results right away.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think learning to code with the intention of building the next Facebook is a good idea either. You&#39;ll get discouraged pretty quickly with that mindset too.</p>
<p>The best and most enjoyable way to code, for me at least, is to build something that you genuinely want to create because you think it is cool or meaningful - not because you think other people will buy or even use it, but because you feel that it's an interesting or useful project.</p>
<p>And at first it&#39;s definitely hard to get those ideas out of your head or to even find them in the first place. But once you get started, you&#39;ll learn to sense when inspiration for a project is there. For me, it&#39;s usually coupled with some illegible notes on small pieces of paper, maybe some penciled diagrams and basic math on the side.</p>

<p>Something I notice now, looking back, about my idea generation is that it's largely tied to my passions that are completely unrelated to CS. Some of your best projects will emerge from your attempts to use code to improve or explore some other parts of your life. I like gardening, for example. However, I am pretty lazy and don't always feel like checking on my plants. So, I wrote up a quick little script on my Raspberry Pi that would take readings from a $5 soil moisture sensor and text my phone whenever my plants needed water. It was nothing impressive (about 20-30 lines of code), but in the moment, being able to build something like that felt genuinely amazing. Another example: I like hiking and observing nature. So one day, I decided to write a script that would read a huge list of trails in our state from a database and plug each of their coordinates into a trig formula with my own in order to find the trails closest in distance to my home.</p>

<p>Even if your idea seems crazy or impossible with your current knowledge or skillset, I promise, from my own experience, it is always worth a try. If you're willing to just sit down and grind through the process of building something meaningful, you will always learn something.</p>
<p>I remember my first big project: a Twitter snow day bot for Trumbull schools.</p>
<p>I knew what it would have to do - scrape the Snow Day Calculator for the percentage data, and then tweet that value if it exceeds a certain likelihood threshold - but I didn&#39;t know how I&#39;d do it yet. I thought that building this bot would be so cool that I didn&#39;t care about having to learn how to use webscraping tools and external APIs like twitter4j. Every time something along the way worked, it felt awesome because I was getting closer and closer to that finished working product.</p>
<p>I think the beauty of these little projects is their perfect balance of simplicity and usefulness. There&#39;s nothing crazy to set up here, you just have to learn a few basic concepts. But in practice, it ends up actually being kind of useful - instead of having to repeatedly check the Calculator every time there&#39;s snow in the forecast, people can just follow the bot and get notified only when there&#39;s a sizable likelihood of cancellation.</p>
