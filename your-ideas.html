<p>I think what discourages many people from programming is this idea of learning a language - say Python - for the sake of knowing a language. If that is your goal, you will probably give up or lose interest, because programming is one of those things where you don&#39;t see crazy results right away.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think learning to code with the intention of building the next Facebook is a good idea either. You&#39;ll get discouraged pretty quickly with that mindset.</p>
<p>The best and most enjoyable way to code, for me, is to build something that you want to create because you think it&#39;s cool - not because you think other people will buy or even use it.</p>
<p>I love the idea of being able to think of some crazy project that&#39;s based on a few core principles and push it out of my mind into a working piece of software using code. It&#39;s just so amazing to me.</p>
<p>And at first it&#39;s definitely hard to get those ideas out of your head or to even find them in the first place. But once you get started, you&#39;ll learn to sense when inspiration for a project is there. You can feel it in the air around you. For me, it&#39;s usually coupled with some illegible notes on small pieces of paper, maybe some penciled diagrams and basic math on the side.</p>
<p>Even if your idea seems crazy, or impossible with your current knowledge or skillset, I promise, from my own experience, it is always worth a try. You always learn something along the way.</p>
<p>I remember my first project: a Twitter snow day bot for Trumbull schools.</p>
<p>I knew what it would have to do - scrape the Snow Day Calculator for the percentage data, and then tweet that value if it exceeds a certain likelihood threshold - but I didn&#39;t know how I&#39;d do it yet. I thought that building this bot would be so cool that I didn&#39;t care about having to learn how to use webscraping tools and external APIs like twitter4j. Every time something along the way worked, it felt amazing because I was getting closer and closer to this finished working product.</p>
<p>I think the beauty of these little projects is their perfect balance of simplicity and usefulness. There&#39;s nothing crazy to set up here, you just have to learn a few basic concepts. But in practice, it ends up actually being kind of useful - instead of having to repeatedly check the Calculator every time there&#39;s snow in the forecast, people can just follow the bot and get notified only when there&#39;s a sizable likelihood of cancellation.</p>
